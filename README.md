# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! To ensure a smooth and effective collaboration, please follow these guidelines:

## How to Contribute

1. **Do Not Merge Code into `main`:**  
   Please do not merge your code directly into the `main` branch. The repository owner will handle the merging of pull requests (PRs). This helps maintain the stability of the `main` branch.

2. **Create a New Branch for Each Task:**  
   For any collaboration or changes, create a new branch from `main`. Name your branch according to the type of work you are doing:
   - For new features: `feature/your-task-title`
   - For bug fixes: `fix/your-fix-title`

   Example:
   git checkout -b feature/your-task-title
Pull Latest Changes Before Pushing:
Before pushing any changes to your branch, make sure to pull the latest changes from the main branch to ensure your branch is up to date:

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout your-branch
git merge main
Write Clear Comments:
Provide clear and descriptive comments in your code. This improves the readability and maintainability of the codebase, making it easier for others to understand your contributions.

Provide Detailed Pull Request Descriptions:
When creating a Pull Request (PR), include a detailed description of your work. Clearly outline what is included in the PR and any relevant details. For example:

**What's in this PR:**
- Login page

**Details:**
- Added a login page for users and admins
- The form accepts user email and password with validation

**Be Patient with PR Reviews:**
Your PR will be reviewed and merged by the repository owner. Please allow 7-10 days for the review process. We appreciate your patience and understanding.

**Summary**
By following these guidelines, you'll help us maintain a clean and organized codebase and ensure a smooth contribution process. Thank you for your cooperation!

If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out to us.

Happy coding!
